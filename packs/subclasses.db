The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo \"the Taming\"—the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.</p><div data-source=\"BH2022\" class=\"rd__b refreshing-brew rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"262\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Blood Hunter 2022\">Heightened Senses</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the improved senses of a natural predator.
