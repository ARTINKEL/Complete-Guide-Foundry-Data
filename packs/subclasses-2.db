However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.</p><h2>DREADFUL STRIKES</h2><p><em>3rd level Fey Wanderer feature</em></p><p>You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn. The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.</p><h2>OTHERWORLDLY GLAMOUR</h2><p><em>3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature</em></p><p>Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p><p>In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.</p><h2>BEGUILING TWIST</h2><p><em>7th-level Fey Wanderer feature</em></p><p>The magic of the Feywild guards your mind.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.</p><h2>FEY REINFORCEMENTS</h2><p><em>11th-level Fey Wanderer feature</em></p><p>The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know summon fey (a spell in chapter 3).

You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration.

You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>In addition, whenever you cast misty step, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you.

The level of the spell is equal to the Leadership Dice spent. The spell save DC for these spells are 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Proficiency bonus. You can also add your Charisma (maximum 2) to your AC so long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield.</p><h2>CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP</h2><p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage done by Rallying Mark, the temporary hit points granted by Urgent Orders, and the attack roll of a creature that gains advantage from Helpful Word.</p><h2>WORDS OF CONVICTION</h2><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use Leadership Dice to cast bless or heroism without providing material components.
