{"name":"Firearm Rules","content":"<p>Most classes do not start with firearm proficiency, as it is learned through hardship and rigor and is an expensive and rare piece of technology forged by dwarves and gnomes. A character can train to use firearms if his character encounters one though it takes rigorous amounts of time and practice as well as gold for training supplies.</p>\n<p>You can ask to have firearm proficiency at character creation depending on your character's backstory and if it fits for them. However, usually there will be a trade-off, or something sacrificed to exchange for this proficiency, unless the backstory is sufficient enough to warrant an exception.</p>\n<p>There are also some feat options available specifically revolved around firearms.</p>\n<p>When you gain firearm proficiency, you also gain proficiency with tinker's tools, which are used to craft various inventions, devices, and repair firearms or manage the use of black powder. all of which is used using your proficiency bonus with said tool kit.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Item</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Damage</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Weight</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Properties</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Flintlock Pistol</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">250 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 30/90), Light, Reload 1, Misfire 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Pepperbox</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 30/90), Light, Reload 6, Misfire 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Musket</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">600 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1d12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 40,120), Reload 1, Two-Handed, Misfire 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Scattergun</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">750 go</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 15/30), Reload 1, Scatter, Two-Handed, Misfire 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Long-Rifle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 100,400), Reload 1, Two-Handed, Misfire 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Revolver</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 40/120), Light, Reload 6, Misfire 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Shotgun</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">7,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2d10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">8 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 20/40), Reload 2, Scatter, Two-Handed, Misfire 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Sniper Rifle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3d12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ammunition (Range 300/1200), Reload 1, Sniper, Two-Handed, Misfire 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Ammunition.</strong> The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.</p>\n<p><strong>Reload.</strong> A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. before having to reload the weapon. A character must then reload it using 1 attack or 1 whole action. you must have a free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><strong>Misfire.</strong> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon's Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful tinker tools check (DC equals 8 + Misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the firearm.</p>\n<p><strong>Scatter.</strong> A weapon with this property can choose to fire a 'scatter-shot\" expending a large burst of ammunition in an outwards cone effect. As an action, you can unleash a blast in a 10 ft cone radius, each creature in that cone must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier) or take normal damage from this weapon. When you perform a 'Scatter Shot', you expend 2d4+1 ammunition.</p>\n<p><strong>Explosive Bullets.</strong> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier) or suffer 2d6 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Sniper.</strong> A sniper rifle is a powerful ranged firearm which can amplify and project ammunition at a highly accelerated speed that can penetrate even the toughest of armors or flesh. Sniper Rifles are unique weapons, in that they normally do 3d12 piercing damage on hit, however, a creature can spend an action to line up a \"Kill Shot\", when they do so, they cannot move from that spot nor can they take any other actions. on their next turn when they fire the sniper sifle, if the attack hits, that creature takes normal weapon damage and then must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier), on a failure, that creature instantly dies. This has no effect on legendary creatures or creatures with legendary actions, and also has no effect on creatures if their CR is higher than your character level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bullets, Black powder, &amp; Ammunition</strong></p>\n<p>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack. Unlike arrows or crossbow bolts, once fired, your ammunition cannot be recovered from the battlefield.</p>\n<p>In addition, firearms require black powder to function and project the bullets as ammunition. When you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you must also expend 1 charge of black powder from whatever satchel or gunpowder horn you are carrying, this black powder is consumed in the process, you must expend a charge for every ammunition fired from your firearm. A firearm cannot function without Black powder.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Powder Bomb</strong></p>\n<p>This bomb can be placed, or thrown up to 60 feet, where it explodes in a 5-foot radius, creatures within the radius must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC 13 or take 3d6 Fire Damage, or half damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>The bomb can also be delayed to explode, holding the explosion until the start of your next turn, you must declare that you wish to delay the bomb's explosion with your DM.</p>\n<p><strong>Gunpowder Keg</strong></p>\n<p>This barrel of black powder cannot be thrown, but when placed can create a massive fireball when lit, where it explodes in a 20 foot radius, creatures within the radius must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC 13 or take 8d6 fire damage, or half damage on a successful save. The keg can also be delayed to explode, holding the explosion until the start of your next turn, you must declare that you wish to delay the keg's explosion with your DM. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting Black Powder</strong></p>\n<p>A well-guarded secret by gnomes and dwarves, it requires the mixture of charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur, in a very dangerous and volatile process. As such, only those proficient in alchemist's supplies can understand the process to handle such a mixture. the process to make black powder on average is 1 hour, and requires a nature check, which you can add your proficiency bonus from your alchemist's supplies to the check. The DC is usually determined by the DM and can range depending on the amount of black powder you are intending to craft in one sitting, the DM uses discretion at this time.</p>\n<table style=\"width:62.3255%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:29.4278%\"><strong>Item</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.7413%\"><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:37.9712%\"><strong>Weight</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:29.4278%\">Charcoal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.7413%\">5 cp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:37.9712%\">1 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:29.4278%\">Saltpeter</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.7413%\">4 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:37.9712%\">1 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:29.4278%\">Sulfur</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.7413%\">5 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:37.9712%\">1 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"IQPdY07Y2p8Hu0Eu":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.efQUm1zFPaz1q8np"}},"_id":"bCm4AxU7OQr3tiiX"}
