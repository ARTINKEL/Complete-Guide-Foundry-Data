Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.</p><p>In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MPMM pg. 10","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"MPMM","hash":"changeling_mpmm","propDroppable":"race"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Pkzpbna1n2TICF6L"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"pOeamXmLdCFJ1NkI"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/MPMM/Changeling.png","ownership":{"default":0,"IQPdY07Y2p8Hu0Eu":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674080329120,"modifiedTime":1674080527275,"lastModifiedBy":"IQPdY07Y2p8Hu0Eu"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"N0WMep7SUEF3ljsD"}

Using that magic, eladrin can step from one place to another in the blink of an eye, and each eladrin resonates with emotions captured in the Feywild in the form of seasons—affinities that affect the eladrin's mood and appearance. An eladrin's season can change, though some remain in one season forever. Choose your season or roll on the Eladrin Seasons table. Your Trance trait lets you change your season.</p><p>Like other elves, eladrin can live to be over 750 years old.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Eladrin Seasons</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Season</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">Autumn: peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\">Winter: contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\">Spring: cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment and hope as winter's sorrow passes.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\">Summer: boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy and calls to action.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MPMM pg. 13","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"MPMM","hash":"eladrin_mpmm","propDroppable":"race"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.uE9XRfzBfFdN9AtW"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"6KiJUIP6SMqKWoeT"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/MPMM/Eladrin.png","ownership":{"default":0,"IQPdY07Y2p8Hu0Eu":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674080329261,"modifiedTime":1674080530796,"lastModifiedBy":"IQPdY07Y2p8Hu0Eu"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"ERBTmzT3g06jsG82"}
